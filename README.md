# kural
A webapp that serves as a bridge of communication between the public and the government.

Motive
----
The main motive of developing kural was to eliminate the middle man & in providing guarantee when dealing with day-to-day issues by the public. For instance, say, the streetlights in your street has not been working for the past few days. The instinctive method of approaching the issue is by filing a complaint with your area councillor and pray to God for the issue to be resolved. You do not have any guarantee that the issue **will** be resolved, you just have to hope. And if the issue persists, how do you approach the problem? This is where our system fails. The system does not have a proper way of punishing the ineffective authorities and awarding the effective ones. 

How kural works
----
Kural eliminates the concept of **waiting and hoping** that an issue gets resolved after filing a complaint. It directly passes the issues up the hierarchy if they aren't resolved after a given frame of time. 

Disclaimer
----
Kural is still in its conceptual phase. We require the government's support to proceed further with this application. We have temporarily halted the development of this project.
